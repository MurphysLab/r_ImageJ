Code to answer questions & assist folks on the ImageJ subreddit, [r/ImageJ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImageJ).

Some are simply demo files.

* images_in_two_folders.ijm -- code to help processing two sets of images in separate folders, such as where one is used to generate an ROI, which is then applied to an image in the other folder. See this [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImageJ/comments/3bjv3u/batch_processing_and_redirecting_to_another_image/).
* mark_angles.ijm -- automatically mark angles. See this [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImageJ/comments/3bc330/help_using_imagej_to_calculate_angles_and_width/). See this [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImageJ/comments/3d9fhl/help_improve_my_macro_by_identifying_camera_make/).
* finding_a_substring_in_image_info.ijm -- Find a specific substring within the output of *getImageInfo()*.
* spinning_patterns.ijm -- Rotate a sinusoidal pattern. See this [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImageJ/comments/3dzjzj/need_to_produce_a_video_like_a_spinning_wheel/).
* itemize_stack_particles.ijm -- used to apply a consistent set of item labels to particles in an image stack, in order to enable tracking. See this [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImageJ/comments/3euehw/need_help_creating_a_particle_numbering_scheme/).
* segmented_line_lengths_and_angles.ijm -- Measure & mark the lengths and angles in a segmented line with an overlay. See this [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImageJ/comments/44y1at/average_angle_of_connected_line_segments/).
